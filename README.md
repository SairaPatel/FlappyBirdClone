# Flappy Bird Clone #

## Background ## 

This is an old project from 2021. It is a simple clone of Flappy Bird using Pygame. 
This was one of the first (non-text-based) Python projects that I created after I taught myself Python during lockdown. Definetely not my best work, but I thought it would be fun to share!

## The Game ##
- User can use their mouse or Space bar to make the bird flap. 
- If the bird touches a green pipe or the floor, it dies.
- The score is the number of pipes that the bird passes before dying
